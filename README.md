# Analysis of Step Count Increase on Lecture Days

### Motivation
Since I started attending classes at Sabancı University, I think my step count increases on lecture days because I commute to campus. This project is my way of investigating how much my class schedule actually affects my daily physical activity by analyzing the data I collect.

Data Source:
I'll be using my own fitness data collected through the health app on my smartphone, which records my step count daily. I'll export this data to a CSV file. Also, I'll match these records with my class schedule taken from the university’s academic calendar.

Data Analysis:
I'm planning to analyze my data using the following steps:

- Data Collection and Cleaning: I'll export my step count data into CSV format and then clean it by aligning each day's data with my lecture schedule.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I'll use visuals like histograms, boxplots, and time series charts to see if there's a clear difference between step counts on days I have classes and days I don't.
- Hypothesis Testing: I'll perform t-tests to check if the difference in step counts between lecture days and non-lecture days is statistically significant.
- Machine Learning: I'll apply classification models, like logistic regression or decision trees, to try and predict lecture days based solely on the step count data.

Findings:
From this project, I want to find out:

- How much more I walk on average during lecture days compared to non-lecture days
- Whether there's a noticeable difference in how my daily steps are distributed
- If my class schedule significantly affects my overall daily activity levels
- How accurately I can predict lecture days using machine learning methods

Limitations and Future Work:
I recognize some limitations in my project, and I've thought about ways to improve it:

- Limitations: My data is limited by the accuracy of my smartphone's step counting, the relatively short time period of data collection, and not considering seasonal changes.
- Future Work: In future studies, I'd like to collect data over a longer period, use multiple devices to check the accuracy of step counts, and include activities outside of lectures to have a broader analysis.
